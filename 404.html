  <p>
    I'm sorry, but whatever it was you were looking for can't seem to be located.
    It could be that I've moved it to some other location, althogh it sure wasn't
    very nice of me to do that without properly redirecting. I bet you can find whatever
    you were looking for if you <a href="/archives.html">check the archives</a>.
  </p>

    Again, sorry. This is a bit awkward. Just in case, here is a list of my most recent posts:

  <h5>Recent Ramblings</h5>
  <ul>
  {% for post in site.posts limit: 5 %} 
    {% unless forloop.last %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <span class="date">{{ post.date | date_to_long_string }}</span>
    </li>
    {% else %}
    <li class="the_end">
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      <span class="date">{{ post.date | date_to_long_string }}</span>
    </li>
    {% endunless %}
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
