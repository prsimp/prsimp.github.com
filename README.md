# This is my blog

It is transfomed into a static site using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I use [HAML](http://haml-lang.com) for the layouts and SCSS via [Compass](http://compass-style.com) for the styling. The posts are written in Markdown locally and then rsync'd to my server. You can check out my Rakefile for the rake tasks I use for new post creation, development, blog generation, and deployment. All of this is a relatively constant work-in-progress so let me know if something doesn't work on your system.
